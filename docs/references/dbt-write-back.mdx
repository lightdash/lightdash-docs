# dbt Write-Back

dbt Write-Back allows you to develop your models and metrics in Lightdash and write back these changes to your dbt project. You can use write back to develop models in the [SQL Runner](/references/sql-runner) or develop metrics using [custom metrics](/references/custom-fields#custom-metrics) in the Explorer. Writing back to dbt will create a new branch and start a pull request in your dbt project so you can save and manage these changes in your dbt project.


We recommend using dbt Write-Back if you're planning to use a query or metric regularly so it can be governed and managed like other dbt models and metrics available in your Lightdash project.

:::info

- dbt Write-Back is currently only available for dbt projects hosted in GitHub. 
- You need to have at least `developer` permissions in a project to use dbt Write-Back.

## Write-Back models from the SQL Runner

You can use Lightdash to build models in dbt from queries that you've built in the SQL runner. We recommend writing back models from the SQL runner if you're planning to use the query regularly so it can be easily used, governed and managed like other dbt models in your Lightdash project.

To get started, build and run a query in the SQL runner, then select the `Write back to dbt` option from the `save` drop-down.

You'll be asked to enter a name that will be used as the model name and file names in your dbt project. Clicking `open pull request` will open a pull request created by Lightdash against your dbt project in GitHub.

/>

The new model will be written to your dbt project in a `models/lightdash/` directory. The model will have the tag `created-by-lightdash` included in the model config.

## Configuring your dbt write-back models in Lightdash

### Getting your model to appear as a `Table` in Lightdash

You might need to adjust your Table Configuration settings in your project to have your new models appear as Tables in Lightdash.

If you've selected:

- `show entire project` then you don't need to do anything. The models should appear automatically if you refresh your dbt project connection.
- `show models with any of these tags`, you'll need to add `created-by-lightdash` to the list of accepted tags. By default, models that you write back to dbt will have the tag `created-by-lightdash` included in the model config.
- `show models in this list`, you'll need to manually add the new models to the list of accepted models here.

### Running your models in dbt

If you get an `Error: not found your_table_name`, it's likely because you haven't built the table generated by your new model in your data warehouse yet. There are a couple of ways to handle this:

#### Manual approach

Once your model is merged to your dbt project, you can run `dbt run -s your_model_name_here` to create the table in your data warehouse. You might need to add `--target prod` if your default profile is set to `dev`!

#### Automated approach using dbt Cloud

If you're using dbt Cloud to manage your dbt project, you can create a job that will automatically run any new models with the tag `created-by-lightdash`.

To create a job that does this, you'll want to:

1. open dbt Cloud, head to `Deploy` --> `Jobs` and click `create new job`
2. toggle on `triggered by pull requests` in the `Git Trigger` section
3. add the command `dbt run --select tag:created-by-lightdash`
4. set `compare changes against environment` to `prod`. This will make sure that this job only runs when a model is changed from your pull request

## Write-Back metrics from custom metrics

You can build custom metrics in Lightdash and write these back to your dbt project. 

We recommend using dbt write-back for custom metrics that you're using/creating frequently so they become metrics that are reusable, governed and available for everyone else to build from.

:::info 

**What's the difference between a metric and a custom metric?**

[Metrics](/references/metrics) written to your dbt project (or YAML metrics) are reusable by everyone in your project and will show up in the list of available metrics for a Table. [Custom metrics](/references/custom-fields#custom-metrics) are only saved in the chart they're used in and will not be saved in the list of `metrics` available if you open the same Table to build a new chart. 

:::

To get started, create a [custom metric](/references/custom-fields#custom-metrics) in the Explorer. Hover over the custom metric in the sidebar and click on the three-dot menu, then `write back to dbt`.

# Content as code

You can download your charts and dashboards as code, make changes, then upload your changes back to your Lightdash project using the CLI. Content as code is also useful for creating new Lightdash projects where you want the content to be copied from an existing project and added to your new project.

## `lightdash download` downloads content as code

From the [Lightdash CLI](/references/lightdash-cli), you can use the command `lightdash download` to download all of the charts and dashboards from your Lightdash project as code. All of the charts and dashboards will be written as .yml files to a `lightdash` directory inside of your dbt project. 

#### Running `lightdash download` will overwrite any changes you have locally

For example:
- I run `lightdash download` and one of the charts that is downloaded is `emea-revenue-per-month.yml`
- I make some changes to the `emea-revenue-per-month.yml` file and save them
- I **do not** upload my changes, they are just saved locally
- I run `lightdash download` again 
- The changes I made to `emea-revenue-per-month.yml` will be overwritten by the latest chart version downloaded from the Lightdash application 

## `lightdash upload` updates or creates any content as code to your project

From the [Lightdash CLI](/references/lightdash-cli), you can use the command `lightdash upload` to upload any updated charts and dashboards saved as .yml in your `lightdash/` directory in your dbt project to the Lightdash application. 

#### Only content as code that you've made changes to will be uploaded 

For example: 
- I have a chart that I've downloaded as code called `total-sales-worldwide.yml` in my `lightdash/` directory
- I only make changes to that chart's .yml
- I run `lightdash upload`
- `total-sales-worldwide.yml` is the only file that gets uploaded because it's the only file that I made changes to

Here's another example:
- Katie has a chart that she's downloaded as code called `total-sales-worldwide.yml` in her `lightdash/` directory
- She doesn't make any changes to the chart as code
- Javi opens the same chart, `Total sales worldwide`, in the Lightdash application, makes some changes, and saves them
- Now, Katie's `total-sales-worldwide.yml` and the `Total sales worldwide` chart in the application are different.
- Katie runs `lightdash upload`
- Katie's `total-sales-worldwide.yml` does **not** get uploaded because she made no changes to the chart as code
- Javi's changes to the `Total sales worldwide` chart that he made in the Lightdash application are **not** overwritten (the version he created is what we see in the Lightdash application)

Here's another example:
- João runs `lightdash download` and downloads all of the charts from his Lightdash project
- Jose opens the same Lightdash project in the Lightdash application and creates a new chart called `Weekly customer support metrics`
- João doesn't have this new chart as code because he hasn't re-run `lightdash download` since the chart was created
- João makes some changes to a different chart, then runs `lightdash upload`
- The chart that Jose created called `Weekly customer support metrics` stays in the Lightdash project, unchanged. It isn't deleted just because it doesn't exist in João's charts as code when he runs `lightdash upload`.

#### Content that's been downloaded as code can still be updated in the Lightdash application

For example:
- There is a Lightdash project called `Stellar Marketing`
- Priyanka runs `lightdash download` and downloads all of the project's content as code, including a chart called `Total new clients`
- Jake opens the `Total new clients` chart in the Lightdash application and makes some changes
- Priyanka doesn't run `lightdash download`, so the `total-new-clients.yml` chart that Priyanka has as code is the old version of the chart, before Jake updated it. 
- Priyanka makes changes to `total-new-clients.yml` then runs `lightdash upload` and uploads her changes and overwrites the changes that Jake made in the Lightdash application. 
- Both Jake and Priyanka can update the same chart as code, or in the Lightdash application.

## Lightdash content templates

You can use the `lightdash download` and `lightdash upload` commands to easily build templates for Lightdash content and reuse these templates to build new or update existing projects. 

### Creating a new Lightdash project from a Lightdash template

If you're creating many dbt projects with similar models and want to easily spin up new versions of these projects, but with different table, field, or chart names, then you can use content as code to create a Lightdash template of your project to reuse. 

To do this, you'll need to:
- Take your existing Lightdash project with all of the content that you want to copy. 
- In the CLI, run `lightdash download` to download all of the content as code from the project
- Navigate to your new dbt project that you want to connect to Lightdash. 
- Copy-paste over the `lightdash/` directory inside your new dbt project with all of the content as code from your template project (or, only copy over the content that you want to use in your new project)
- In your new `lightdash/` directory, if your **table names** or **column names** changed between your dbt projects, you'll need to update these in your content's .yml files. If only the schema or database names changed between projects, you do not need to update anything. 
  - E.g. in my dbt project `Sales reporting Walmart`, I have a table like `global-database.walmart.sales_daily`. I create a new dbt project called `Sales reporting Costco` with a table like `global-database.costco.sales_daily`. In this example, only the schema changed between the two projects, so any content in Lightdash from `Sales reporting Walmart` will also work if I copy-paste it into `Sales reporting Costco`.
- Once you're happy with your content, you're going to run `lightdash config set-project` and select your new Lightdash project from the list of projects
- Then, you'll run `lightdash upload` to upload all of the content as code you've added in your `lightdash/` directory to your new Lightdash project

### Adding content to an existing project from a Lightdash template

Sometimes, if you're managing multiple dbt projects with similar models, you want to be able to easily create and manage the same charts and dashboards across all of the projects at the same time. You can do this with content as code to create a Lightdash template project.

- You want to create a Lightdash project that only contains all of the content that you want to share across your projects
- From your CLI, you can run `lightdash download` to download all of this content as code 
- You can then copy-paste the .yml files that get written across to any of the other dbt projects you have where you want to reuse the same charts and dashboards. 
- In the dbt projects where you're copying the chart and dashboard .yml files over to, if your **table names** or **column names** change between your dbt projects, you'll need to update these in your content's .yml files. If only the schema or database names changed between projects, you do not need to update anything. 
  - E.g. in my dbt project `Sales reporting Walmart`, I have a table like `global-database.walmart.sales_daily`. I create a new dbt project called `Sales reporting Costco` with a table like `global-database.costco.sales_daily`. In this example, only the schema changed between the two projects, so any content in Lightdash from `Sales reporting Walmart` will also work if I copy-paste it into `Sales reporting Costco`.
- Once you've copied over any content that you wanted to manage across projects, from the CLI, you should run `lightdash config set-project` and select the project where you've added these new charts/dashboards as code to. 
- Then, you should run `lightdash upload` to upload all of the new content as code.

# Content as code

You can download your charts and dashboards as code, make changes, then upload your changes back to your Lightdash project using the CLI. Content as code is also useful for creating new Lightdash projects where you want the content to be copied from an existing project and added to your new project.

## `lightdash download` downloads content as code

From the [Lightdash CLI](/references/lightdash-cli), you can use the command `lightdash download` to download all of the charts and dashboards from your Lightdash project as code. All of the charts and dashboards will be written as .yml files to a `lightdash` directory inside of your dbt project. 

#### Running `lightdash download` will overwrite any changes you have locally

For example:
- I run `lightdash download` and one of the charts that is downloaded is `emea-revenue-per-month.yml`
- I make some changes to the `emea-revenue-per-month.yml` file and save them
- I **do not** upload my changes, they are just saved locally
- I run `lightdash download` again 
- The changes I made to `emea-revenue-per-month.yml` will be overwritten by the latest chart version downloaded from the Lightdash application

#### Content that's been downloaded as code can still be updated in the Lightdash application

For example:
- There is a Lightdash project called `Stellar Marketing`
- Priyanka runs `lightdash download` and downloads all of the project's content as code, including a chart called `Total new clients`
- Jake opens the `Total new clients` chart in the Lightdash application and makes some changes
- Priyanka doesn't run `lightdash download`, so the `total-new-clients.yml` chart that Priyanka has as code is the old version of the chart, before Jake updated it. 
- Priyanka makes changes to `total-new-clients.yml` then uploads her changes and overwrites the changes that Jake made in the Lightdash application. 
- Both Jake and Priyanka can update the same chart as code, or in the Lightdash application. 

## `lightdash upload` updates or creates any content as code to your project

From the [Lightdash CLI](/references/lightdash-cli), you can use the command `lightdash upload` to upload all of the charts and dashboards saved as .yml in your `lightdash/` directory in your dbt project to the Lightdash application. 

#### Only content that you've made changes to as code will be uploaded 

For example: 
- I have a chart that I've downloaded as code called `total-sales-worldwide.yml` in my `lightdash/` directory
- I haven't made any changes to the chart
- I run `lightdash upload`
- `total-sales-worldwide.yml` does not get uploaded because there were no changes

Here's another example:
- Katie has a chart that she's downloaded as code called `total-sales-worldwide.yml` in her `lightdash/` directory
- She doesn't make any changes to the chart as code
- Javi opens the same chart `Total sales worldwide` in the Lightdash application, makes some changes, and saves them
- Now, Katie's `total-sales-worldwide.yml` and the `Total sales worldwide` chart in the application are different.
- Katie runs `lightdash upload`
- Katie's `total-sales-worldwide.yml` does **not** get uploaded because she made no changes to the chart as code
- Javi's changes to the `Total sales worldwide` chart that he made in the Lightdash application are **not** overwritten (the version he created is what we see in the Lightdash application)

# Content as code

You can download your charts and dashboards as code, make changes, then upload your changes back to your Lightdash project using the CLI. Content as code is also useful for creating new Lightdash projects where you want the content to be copied from an existing project and added to your new project.

## `lightdash download` downloads content as code

From the [Lightdash CLI](/references/lightdash-cli), you can use the command `lightdash download` to download all of the charts and dashboards from your Lightdash project as code. All of the charts and dashboards will be written as .yml files to a `lightdash` directory inside of your dbt project. 

#### Running `lightdash download` will overwrite any changes you have locally

For example:
- I run `lightdash download` and make changes to a chart `emea-revenue-per-month.yml`
- I run `lightdash download` again (without uploading my changes)
- The changes I made to `emea-revenue-per-month.yml` will be overwritten by the latest chart version downloaded from the Lightdash application

#### Content that's been downloaded as code can still be updated in the Lightdash application

For example:
- There is a Lightdash project called `Stellar Marketing`
- Priyanka runs `lightdash download` and downloads all of the project's content as code, including a chart called `Total new clients`
- Jake updates the `Total new clients` chart in the `Stellar Marketing` project in the Lightdash application
- The `Total new clients` chart that Priyanka has as code will be the old version of the chart, before Jake updated it. 
- Priyanka makes changes to `Total new clients` then uploads her changes and overwrites the changes that Jake made in the Lightdash application. 

## `lightdash upload` uploads any changes from code to your project
